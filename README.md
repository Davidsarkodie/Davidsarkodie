- 👋 Hi, I’m @Davidsarkodie
- 👀 I’m interested in building dynamic Websites using JavaScript and PHP. I believe I'm a stretagist within the digital marketing as I have prior experience using social media platforms to increase traffic and user engagement which led to increasing our conversion rate.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my PHP skills for wordpress, as I read through the book PHP & MySQL by the author Jon Duckett
- 💞️ In the future I would like to become a top expert in developing websites for E-commerces and blockchain dapps (Decentralised Applications)
